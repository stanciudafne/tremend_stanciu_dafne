I chose as my application calculator.py.
I used an official Python runtime as a base image: Python:3.9
I copied my files into the container by using the command ADD.
I installed my dependencies from the requirements.txt by using the command RUN.
I used the command EXPOSE 8080, which is giving the ability yo my app to be reachable via this port from outside the container
And finnally to RUN the python app I used the command CMD.
docker build -t python-calculator . -this command I used to build my application
I did the setup for the docker on docker hub and Git, but I was unnable to push the image
I tried to push everything also from docker desktop, but still unable to do so.
